## Overview

Born out of [CivicTechTO](http://civictech.ca/), Toronto Tech Mentoring is a volunteer run organisation aimed at supporting youth in the Greater Toronto Area through mentorship and education in technology and coding. Due to the success of the not for profit program and the desire to scale to accomodate this rising interest, a website is being developed to provide information for volunteers, clients and partners.

<br/>
The website is being developed by volunteers sharing a passion to teach one another and develop sharper coding skills in web development and React.
